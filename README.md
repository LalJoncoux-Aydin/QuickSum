# QuickSum

In this practical, we had to realize a small application that has to sum multiple numbers and has to clear the result. To accomplish that, I followed the explanations in the practical and at the end I just had to add the clearing button.\
As I studied for 3 years in a school oriented towards the autonomous learning from projects, I have difficulties in the theorical aspects but for the practical aspects, this exercise felt really easy. Furthermore, I started learning coding with C and C++, so I don’t have any difficulties with Java that is really similar on multiple aspects to C++.\
With all the theoretical lectures I had this week, I was happy to have to code. Project was really easy to realize.\
When I saw that filling the result variable was redundant in both “summing” and “clearing” methods, I created a private “tool” function to separate it.\
I didn’t knew about the “andoird:onClick” attribute and I am glad to have discovered that, it makes the attribution of methods to button faster. I also didn’t knew about the “style” attribute, could have gained me some time in the past since using a shape drawable is quite time consuming.
